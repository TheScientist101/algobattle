# AlgoBattle

A platform for hosting stock market trading bots


## Use our demo (RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS)

Go to: https://algobattle.vercel.app

When prompted to login, choose either of the sign-up options, we recommend Signing In With Google. If you are not interested in making an account, sign in using `luna@email.com` for the username and `imbadatcs` for the password.

When you sign in, if there is no example bot created, click on the "Create a bot" button. Choose a name for the bot and click on the "Save" button. Reload the page to show information about your newly created bot. You may notice that there is no historical account value, and this is expected. It may take a couple minutes for the data to appear.

If you have made a bot that is compatible with our API, go ahead and use your API key to connect your bot to our servers. If not, use [this](https://urjithmishra.postman.co/workspace/Urjith-Mishra's-Workspace~43538fc0-c30d-40e3-8045-90c077511b1d/collection/44405624-4dc9bb5a-f0dd-4c42-91c9-679ae5220c1d?action=share&creator=44405624) Postman link that has examples.

You will notice that transactions appear on the dashboard, and your account will be revalued daily. We are working on having more frequently updated stock data so you will have more accurate account estimates.

|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Abhinav Devarakonda|  I built the web application of AlgoBattle, including authentication pages and a dashboard containing information on all the user's trading bots, including their value over time, their transactions, their api keys, their account value, and the cash they have. Furthermore, I created a learboard page that shows which bots have made the most money.               |
| Urjith Mishra| I built the server-side code that any bot you write will interface with. This code also generates the value histories that are viewed on the web dashboard page, executes trades, calculates account values, provides stock pricing data, and validates API keys.|
